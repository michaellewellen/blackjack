# blackjack
This will be starting off with black jack because I wanted to create a 'card' class.  Currently the card class has 
* suit
* number (A,2,3... K)
* value 
Along with a method to print a card in the right place

Working on the game play, I hope to extend this into a proper Casino game
where there will be a slot machine, a roulette table and a craps table. 

We'll see how ambitious I am.
